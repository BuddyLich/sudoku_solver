# sudoku_solver
A practice html/css/javaScript project, it is a web app that can solve sudoku puzzle.

Currently the web App work, but there are a lot of things to be imporved:

* The looking of the web page is too simple. Same with the game board
* There is a button to create a default puzzle, which is hard coded inside js file. I want to make an algorithm to generate different puzzle.
